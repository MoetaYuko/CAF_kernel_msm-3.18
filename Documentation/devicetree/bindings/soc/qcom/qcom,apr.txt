Qualcomm APR (Asynchronous Packet Router) binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm APR. APR is a IPC protocol for
communication between Application processor and QDSP. APR is mainly
used for audio/voice services on the QDSP.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,apr-<SOC-NAME>" example: "qcom,apr-msm8996"


- qcom,smd-channel:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: standard SMD property specifying the SMD channel used for
		    communication with the APR on QDSP.
		    Should be "apr_audio_svc".
		    Described in soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a QDSP based sound card on a MSM8996 device
which uses apr as communication between Apps and QDSP.

	apr {
		compatible = "qcom,apr-msm8996";
		qcom,smd-channels = "apr_audio_svc";
	};
